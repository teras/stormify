# Module stormify-kotlin

Stormify is an ORM platform that allows you to easily perform queries
on a database, using Java classes, with an extremely lightway mechanism. No compiler plugins are
required, the information is retrieved lazily and gathered by the entity itself, without
the need of complex user configuration, annotations or XML files. The common conventions
are used instead, with the possibility of overriding them when necessary.

This module provides Kotlin extensions for the Stormify ORM platform, that target primarily CRUD operations and foreign
key handling.

Please browse the extension functions for more information.
