/**
 * This package contains the core implementation of the Stormify platform.
 * <p>
 * Stormify is an ORM platform that allows you to easily perform queries
 * on a database, using Java classes, with an extremely lightway mechanism. No compiler plugins are
 * required, the information is retrieved lazily and gathered by the entity itself, without
 * the need of complex user configuration, annotations or XML files. The common conventions
 * are used instead, with the possibility of overriding them when necessary.
 * <p>
 * The main class and entry point is {@link onl.ycode.stormify.StormifyManager}.
